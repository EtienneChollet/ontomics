# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ABSOLUTE RULE — No AI attribution

**NEVER mention Claude Code, Anthropic, ChatGPT, Codex, OpenAI, or any AI tool in commits, PRs, issues, comments, or any git artifact.** No "Co-Authored-By", no "Generated with", no AI attribution of any kind. This applies to all text that enters the git history or appears on GitHub.

## ABSOLUTE RULE — Worktree workflow

**ALL source code and test changes MUST go through a worktree branch and PR.** Never commit implementation work directly to main.

Workflow:
1. Create a feature branch: `epc28/<description>` (associate with a Linear issue when one exists)
2. Use `git worktree` or the Agent tool's `isolation: "worktree"` to work in an isolated copy
3. Implement, test, commit on the feature branch
4. Create a PR from the feature branch to main
5. Merge to main only after review/validation

Direct commits to main are only acceptable for version bumps and release automation (cargo-release).

## ABSOLUTE RULE — Embeddings must stay enabled

**NEVER disable embeddings** (`embeddings.enabled = false`) in any `.ontomics/config.toml` for any codebase without explicit permission from the user. Embeddings are a core part of the pipeline — disabling them silently degrades concept discovery, clustering, and suggest_name quality.

## ABSOLUTE RULE — Tests are sacred

**NEVER modify, delete, weaken, skip, or rewrite any test without explicit permission from the user.** This is the single most important rule in this project. No exceptions.

- If a test fails, the implementation is wrong — fix the implementation.
- Do not change assertions, expected values, or test structure to make a failing test pass.
- Do not add `#[ignore]`, comment out, or remove failing tests.
- Do not refactor tests "for clarity" or "consistency" unless explicitly asked.
- The only time a test may be modified is when the user explicitly says to modify that specific test.
- Do not widen assertion windows (e.g., top_n thresholds) to absorb implementation regressions.
- Do not remove expected entities, concepts, or conventions from test expectations.
- Do not replace specific assertions with weaker structural checks.
- Do not "update expectations to match reality" — reality must match expectations.
- Do not relax naming checks, convention checks, or entity lists because the tool produces wrong output.
- Do not move must-contain items to should-contain or drop them entirely.
- Failing testbed tests are bugs in `src/`, not bugs in `tests/`.
- The testbed expectations are the definition of done — they define what ontomics MUST produce.
- Any change to analysis logic (TF-IDF, stop words, convention detection) that breaks testbed expectations must be fixed in the analysis code until the tests pass, not by weakening the tests.
- When in doubt: the test is right, the implementation is wrong.

## What this is

ontomics is a Rust MCP server that extracts domain ontologies from codebases (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust). It parses source files with tree-sitter, clusters related identifiers by embedding similarity, detects naming conventions, and exposes the results as MCP tools. Runs locally with no API keys.

## Build and test

```bash
cargo build --release          # production binary
cargo build                    # debug build
cargo test                     # all tests (~200, inline in each module)
cargo test --lib config        # tests in a single module
cargo clippy                   # lint (must pass with zero warnings)
```

Optional feature flag: `cargo build --features lsp` enables pyright-based LSP enrichment for inheritance chains.

Releases use `cargo-dist` (see `dist-workspace.toml`). CI builds on tag push via `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Targets: macOS (aarch64, x86_64), Linux (x86_64, glibc 2.28+). Distributed via Homebrew, npm (`@ontomics/ontomics`), and shell installer.

## Architecture

The pipeline runs in this order. Each module is a single file under `src/`.

1. **`parser.rs`** — `LanguageParser` trait with implementations for Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust. Uses tree-sitter to walk ASTs and extract `RawIdentifier`, `Signature`, `ClassInfo`, `CallSite`. Parallel file parsing via rayon.

2. **`tokenizer.rs`** — Splits identifiers into subtokens (`spatial_transform` → `["spatial", "transform"]`), handles snake_case, camelCase, ALLCAPS boundaries. Also detects abbreviations.

3. **`analyzer.rs`** — TF-IDF scoring on subtokens to find domain-specific concepts. Builds `Concept` nodes, `Convention` patterns, and `Relationship` edges (co-occurrence, abbreviation). Takes `AnalysisParams` (min_frequency, tfidf_threshold, convention_threshold).

4. **`embeddings.rs`** — `EmbeddingIndex` using candle (`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`, safetensors). Stores concept ID → vector mapping. Used for similarity queries and clustering.

5. **`cluster.rs`** — Agglomerative clustering with average linkage (priority queue, O(N² log N)). Groups concepts by embedding similarity. Assigns `cluster_id` on each `Concept`.

6. **`entity.rs`** — Promotes functions/classes into `Entity` nodes with concept tags and semantic roles. Builds entity-level relationships (Instantiates, InheritsFrom, Uses).

7. **`graph.rs`** — `ConceptGraph` is the central data structure. Holds concepts, relationships, conventions, embeddings, entities, signatures, classes, call_sites. All query methods (query_concept, check_naming, suggest_name, locate_concept, describe_symbol, etc.) live here.

8. **`tools.rs`** — `OntomicsServer` implements `rmcp::ServerHandler`. Maps MCP tool calls to `ConceptGraph` query methods. Supports deferred startup (graph populated in background).

9. **`cache.rs`** — SQLite persistence at `<repo>/.ontomics/index.db`. Auto-invalidation via `ONTOMICS_CACHE_VERSION` (hash of indexing source files, computed in `build.rs`). File watcher (notify) for incremental re-indexing.

10. **`diff.rs`** — `ontology_diff`: parses a base git ref's source tree via git2, re-runs analysis, and diffs concept sets against HEAD.

11. **`domain_pack.rs`** — Export/import of portable YAML domain knowledge (abbreviations, conventions, terms, associations).

12. **`enrichment.rs`** — Background embedding completion. Computes embedding plan (which concepts still need vectors), merges vectors into graph, checks generation staleness.

13. **`config.rs`** — `Config` loaded from `.ontomics/config.toml`. Sections: language, index, analysis, embeddings, cache, resources, conventions, domain_packs.

14. **`types.rs`** — All shared types: `Concept`, `Entity`, `Relationship`, `Convention`, `Occurrence`, `Signature`, `ClassInfo`, `CallSite`, `DomainPack`, query param/result structs.

15. **`lsp.rs`** — Behind `lsp` feature flag. Shells out to pyright for cross-file inheritance resolution.

16. **`main.rs`** — CLI (clap) with subcommands (serve, query, check, suggest, diff, concepts, conventions, describe, locate, briefing, export, entities). Default is `serve` (MCP stdio). Orchestrates the full pipeline: config → parse → analyze → embed → cluster → entity build → graph. Supports deferred embedding (background thread) for fast MCP startup. Parent process watchdog for clean exit.

## Key design decisions

- **`build.rs`** hashes `INDEX_FILES` (entity, analyzer, parser, cache, tokenizer, types) into `ONTOMICS_CACHE_VERSION`. Any change to these files auto-invalidates all caches.
- **Deferred startup**: In serve mode, graph is built without embeddings first, MCP is available immediately, embeddings complete in background thread.
- **No `unwrap()` outside tests, no `panic!` in library code.** Error handling uses `anyhow::Result` throughout.
- **Modules map 1:1 to files** — no `mod.rs` nesting.
- **Entity IDs use a distinct hash namespace** from concept IDs to prevent collisions.
- **`serde(default)`** on cached types ensures old caches deserialize gracefully when new fields are added.

## Configuration

Optional `.ontomics/config.toml` in repo root. All fields have sensible defaults. Key knobs:
- `language`: auto (default), python, typescript, javascript, rust
- `index.min_frequency`: minimum subtoken frequency (default: 2)
- `analysis.domain_specificity_threshold`: TF-IDF cutoff (default: 0.3)
- `embeddings.similarity_threshold`: clustering merge threshold (default: 0.75)
- `resources.max_threads`: rayon thread cap (default: half CPUs)
